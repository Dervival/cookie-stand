Repository for CodeFellows seattle-201d39 Week 2 project
Basic implementation of a sample index and sales data page for the CodeFellows 201 week 2 project (Salmon Cookies) - given some dummy data for various stores that sell cookies made from ground salmon, calculates a random number of hourly customers, computes an average demand of cookies per hour per location, and displays this data in a table along with hourly and daily (per location and city-wide) totals.
