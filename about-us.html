    <h2>How Salmon Cookies Were Made</h2>
    <section id="beforeCookies">
      <p>Pat and his family were an unassuming family of Seattlites (not satellites) living over in Queen Anne at the start of this decade. Pat was a front-end web developer, churning out index pages and replacing lorem ipsum text with actual content for days on end. Pat's spouse was a baker who worked down at the waterfront, creating treats and delicacies for both citizens of the city and tourists alike. Their daughter, Dorothy, attended school over in Fremont and had several friends, none of who were consequential enough to actually make it into this description outside of this oblique sentence. And who could forget their son, <strong>JIMBO, DESTROYER OF WORLDS</strong>, who terrorized the populace with his grim stare and was single-handedly responsible for the Denny regrade? All and all, it was a relatively idyllic life - unfortunately, fate conspired to change all this.</p>

      <p>One fateful morning, Pat and Pat's spouse were on their way to work when <strong>JIMBO</strong> decided to summon a massive swarm of salmon over this city. As expected, the weight of the falling fish destroyed many buildings, including Pat's house, his workplace, and most of the bakery Pat's spouse worked at. Distraught at the loss of his employment and his home, Pat howled at the sky for some recompense. Just as if a benevolent power had been looking over Pat, an idea struck: Pat could survive by creating salmon cookies! No, not salmon colored cookies, but <em>cookies made from ground salmon</em>! Pat commandered what remained of the spouse's bakery and what useful bits of the salmon pile that were left after <strong>JIMBO</strong>'s wrath, and the rest is history.</p>
